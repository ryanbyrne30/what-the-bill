# Scraper

## Phase 1: Extra, Load

First phase of scraping operations is to extract raw info from sources and load it into the database.

## Phase 2: Transform

Second phase is to transform the raw data from the previous step into clean data. This transformation should be decoupled from the first step and be fault tolerant to errors and updates.
